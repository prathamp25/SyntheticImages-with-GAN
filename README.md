# SyntheticImages-with-GAN
We train a GAN on a subset of the CIFAR- 10 dataset. During the training of the GAN, the script will periodically update the weights of the generator and discriminator models based on the loss functions defined. The function generate_and_save_images is designed to generate and save images at the end of each epoch.
